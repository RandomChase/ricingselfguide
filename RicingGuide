Okay, since I want to learn how to "Rice" a linux. I have to download some packages for me to rice.

There are some several installations before we begin.

First come are the window managers. My preference is awesome and openbox for starters, we will begin with them. 

We will begin with openbox - assuming we have the gtk2.0+ dependancies installed in our system, if not, our package manager will do it for ourselves.


So we need to install four programs
    > openbox 
    > obconf
The above two should come with whatever distro's package manager, most of the time. 
    > menumaker
    You can download this here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/menumaker/

So, what is the purpose of the three downloaded software so far?
    -- OpenBox is your window manager.
    -- Obconf will configure openbox's visuals
    -- Menumaker will configure your context menu


After you got these, install these: 
    > rofi
    > lxappearance
    > compton/picom
    >
