Okay, since I want to learn how to "Rice" a Linux. I made this guide for myself
on how to "Rice" my linux installation.

For this guide, we will use the base install terminal emulator and bash. Since I
am on Mint 20.1 with Xfce as my DE,  the base terminal is xfec4-terminal and the
Bash shell. There are alternative terminal emulators and shells, but I will go
with the base for this guide for the sake of simplicity. And I am assuming the
readers of this guide are as well, and on popular OOTB Distros like Mint,
Manjaro, Ubuntu, and what have you and on different DE spins that comes with
their own terminal emulators(KDE being Konsole, Gnome being Gnome-terminal and
etc) and bash shell as default shell.

If you are on a debian based repo try to add this repository. This will help
you install a bunch of software from a package, rather than from source.
https://launchpad.net/~kgilmer/+archive/ubuntu/speed-ricer

Although this guide is for new Ricers, I am assuming you have basic knowledge
on shell commands and how to use the terminal and how to install binaries with
the package manager(apt, dnf, pacman and etc) and downloading source online with
git and wget that comes with your distro.That's the bare minimum prerequisite.

First come are the window managers. My preference is awesome and openbox for
starters, we will begin with them.

As to why I picked them, OpenBox is very mature and documented Stacking Window
Manager while Awesome is a Dynamic Window Manager with a beginner friendly
setup and scripting language. As to why I didn't pick i3 and bspwm,
they require more configurations, and for those who likes gaps, you have to get
another i3, called i3-gaps which are not commonly available in package managers.

We will begin with openbox, assuming we have the gtk2.0+ dependancies installed
in our system, if not, our package manager will do it for ourselves.

So we need to install four programs:
    >   openbox - OpenBox is your window manager.
    >   obconf  - Obconf will configure openbox's visuals. Should come bundled
        on your distro, if not, get this one. As well as obsession-logout
        obsession-exit.
    >   menumaker - Menumaker will configure your context menu i.e the right
        click menu(Openbox calls them pipemenu, basically its native application
        launcher)
        *You can download this here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/menumaker/

After you got the above, install these:
    >   rofi - Rofi is an application launcher, basically type in the program
        to launch it; there are several alternatives, but this one is better
        for beginners.
    >   lxappearance - This will help select the gtk theme of your
        graphical programs. There is oomox, but this one is far easier.
        There is also 'lxappearance-obconf', the latter is just particular
        to openbox and you it if you want lxappearance to have full control
        of obconf.
    >   compton/picom - This is a compositor able to be used on window managers
        rather than DE's like compiz. It will give your more graphical effects
        like dropshadow and transperancy
    >   feh - is a wallpaper selector. Also an image viewer, but it works well
        with openbox and other wms. However, it needs some minimal scripting to
        make it up and running.


Obviously, no Rice is complete without cli softwares i.e a filemanager, a music
player and a panel or taskbars, a notification tray. And other oddities, like
automatic color theme selector for the terminal.

We will get into them more later. But first let's do the base installations.

OPENBOX

While installing - it will suggest several packages, depending on your package
manager. Mine automatically installed obconf, obsession along with openbox.

Now, that it is installed. It's a good idea to logout and login a new session
with openbox.

Now, that you are in openbox, you will see a blank screen with just the mouse.
Wait a minute, if you right click you will get a context menu.
By default it should have a decent menu if you installed it through a package
manager rather than from source, but we are going to make it look better.

First, if we head to ~/.config/openbox and you find only one or two files, there
should be four of them, so copy them from /etc/xdg/openbox to that
home folder. This is if you are sharing the pc, otherwise, those configs in the
xdg are global. There should be 4 files: autostart.sh, environment.sh, menu.xml
and rc.xml.

If you open autostart, you might see gnome, kde or xfce daemons.
These will make those DE work with openbox.

Menu.xml will have your right click menu.You can edit this manually if you want
so or let  menumaker generates one. You can still edit the generated one too.

Now, let's add menumaker. Extract it with the 'tar -xvzf' command and run
'./configure && make && make install' in the folder as sudo, and it will
install so aslong as you have python2 or python3 in your system.
(Tip: you can use mmaker without installing it too, just use the extracted one).

After it has installed, run this command:

'mmaker -t xterm -f OpenBox3'

Remember, if you are using something else, like Fluxbox or IceWM for example,
you can always reference the wiki.archlinux.org for those particular WMs.

Infact, I use the archlinux's wikia in a lot for my other things. I really
think it is a very good resource for beginners on how to setup many things
manually.

Once done. Reset your Openbox, now right click and you will see a nicer menu.
You can also go ahead and delete the menumaker folder and archive, if you want
so. Remember though, if you install a new program and you want it to appear.
You have to reapply menumaker and restart.

In my installation, restart doesn't exists in the menu and had to add it
manually. Open menu.xml, find 'reconfigure', and underneath it add this.

<item label="Restart OpenBox">
    <action name="Execute">
        <execute>openbox --restart</execute>
</action> </item>

You will notice some settings from let's say, Cinnamon or KDE won't carry
over, like the icon theme if you open your file manager and what have you.
There is a work around with OpenBox, but I prefer to use the vanilla OB.

You can install rofi now, if you haven't yet.

You can go ahead and open Openbox configuration. You can change the theme
and what appears on the borders like if you want a close button or a rollup
button instead(reason why it is called stacking window manager, you can open
and stack a bunch of apps on top of each other). Change the fonts here to a more
aesthetic one(more that later) and various other settings you can play with.
Remember rc.xml? This is where it is stored.

If you installed lxappearance, you can use those sweet gtk and icon themes
that comes on the base install of your distro. However, even after using
clicking on them, it seems to only update after logging out and then logging in.

Now let's add some keybindings. Preferrably people use the Windows key as the
Superkey, and that's what I am going to use as well. So let's launch up our
text editor and rc.xml. (Tip: if you don't want to do it manually, you can
install 'obkey' from source).

Head to the section '<!-- Keybindings for running applications -->' section

Just a reminder that 'C' stands for Control, 'S' for shift, 'A' for alt and 'W'
for Windows key i.e the default Superkey for the OpenBox keybindings.

Let's do one for rofi.

<keybind key="W-p">
    <action name="Execute">
        <command>rofi -show run</command>asd
    </action>
</keybind>

If you want the correct name of other keys for they keybindings,
launch  up xev in terminal and click the button you want, it should be on the
3rd row, next to the closing paranthesis. If you want to change rofi's theme,
you have to search for it within rofi's app launcher.

Restart OB and it will be enabled. You can do this for several otherbindings
Like 'W-w' for a web browser and etc. Mine would look like this:
'W-e' for my editor. 'W-return' for terminal(return here is the enter key).

Now time for wallpapers, I suggest you git clone from this repository:
https://gitlab.com/dwt1/wallpapers.git - this is Distrotube's personal wallpaper
collection and they are really neat. I cloned it in my Pictures folder
for ease of access. It has a lot of natural landscapes and less abstract images,
so it is a matter of preferences, but we want you to get up and running so get
those. I also installed Ubuntu's and Mint's wallpapers altogether and removed
whatever I don't personally like.

If you have feh installed. It's high time to add it in our OpenBox autostart.
Launch your favorit editor and put this there

'feh --bg-fill --no-fehbg --randomize /home/$USER/Pictures/Wallpapers/* &'

Well, feh will make the background a fill(there other options like bg-max,
bg-center, bg-scale and etc, so pick your favorite from its man page, I prefer
fill as it zooms in the image to fill the screen).

The '--no-fehbg' will tell feh not to add a .fehbg script for execution.
This script is only good for one background to be reinitialized on your next
login, but if you want multiple rounds of backgrounds, add this command.
The '--randomize' will pick a random picture in the folder you selected.
But it will still stick to the same background for the whole session, for
a fix read the next section.

Alrighty. I am a guy who likes his wallpapers to change from time to time.
If you have a bin in your home folder or ~/.local/bin, we will create
a bash script that will automatically reinitialize feh. Name it whatever you
want, I called it fehchanger.

Create the new file and add this:

#!/usr/bin/env bash
feh --bg-fill --no-fehbg --randomize /home/$USER/Pictures/Wallpapers/*

Then run this in terminal 'chmod +x fehchanger', then test it with ./fehchanger
to see it works, and voila. It did.

Now we want it to repeat periodically and not just stand there at one time.
Your unix or unix-like distro should have cron utility installed by default
and it is running in the background, if you want to use it check some online
guides. For some reason, it didn't work for me.

However, I wrote this script and it worked just fine. So I edited the previous
fehchanger script to this:
'''
#!/usr/bin/env bash
{
while true;do
  feh --bg-fill --no-fehbg --randomize /home/$USER/Pictures/Wallpapers/*
  sleep 3m
done
} &
'''
Obviously, you can change the value of sleep to seconds to minutes and even
hours, and that is up to you.

Now let's go back to our OpenBox autostart file and remove this line
'feh --bg-fill --no-fehbg --randomize /home/$USER/Pictures/Wallpapers/* &'

And in with our script this line (make sure it is runnable with chmod +x):
'/home/$USER/.local/bin/fehchanger &'

Reboot(or run the script once), and it will work just wonderfully.
What I like about feh, is that is really minimal and small. If any case you guys
want to install a minimal distro on an older computer, you know what software to
run on them in the near future. If you 'pgrep sleep', and get a number you know
our little script is working in the background. You can use 'top' to find it,
and you will see how much resource it is taking, it is almost none.

Now that we have sweet wallpapers, let's get some cute effects on our desktop.
Next let's get compton next.

COMPTON/PICOM

There is a good chance that your package manager will have compton if not picom.
Picom is another fork of a compton fork. While compton is the stable release of
other forks(the wonders of open-source projects) it has an old blur algorithms.

Compton by default will search in certain locations, one of them being
~/.config folder. So create an empty .compton.conf file so that we can add
in some valuable things.

I for one like, blur effects and transperent terminals i.e translucent effect.
So for that, I am going to use it. Of course, if you want to add drop shadow
that's another thing.

If we download compton.sample.con from its main repo at
https://github.com/chjj/compton.git  we will have a base. Save it on our file
and just launch 'compton' in terminal and WOAH! Everything is transparent!

Obviously there are options I want to change, maybe you don't want them to have
the same thing. So play around with the option in the conf file.

From several sources, they usually say change the renderer to "glx" rather than
"xrender", especially if you have graphics card capable of handling it.

There is also a delay(from fadein and fadeout) which I don't like. I like
my pc snappy and not like it is Windows Vista all over again.

If you didn't notice your terminal not becoming clear, that means you have to
go to its own config. It won't work without compton, but once you launch compton
it will work.

You have to also make some exclusion for some software you don't want.
Like firefox or chrome or what have you.

Also once you are done doing the settings. Let's go back to our autostart
and just add compton like this

'compton &'

As you launch openbox, every settings will come back up. Of course, if you don't
have a .config file, you can use the commandline arguments and launch it up
like with them like how we did with feh originally.

However in a strange twist of fate I decided to install picom
from source from its github https://github.com/yshui/picom, just in case
you want to build it too, remember it has quite a bunch of dependancies
that needs to be installed.

The only reason is that it has a sweeter blurring algorithm known as
"dual_kawase" (from tryone's compton fork readded here), most of the options
available in compton are available in picom, however if you run picom from
terminal its going to warn you on deprecated options if you are using compton's
config file.

Alright. Now that we are done with compositing. Time to add some dandy bars.
For the sake of this guide, I won't be using docks, just bars.

PANELS/BARS

There three popular bar choices for us to pick: tint2, polybar and lemonbar.
There is also Xmobar, but I don't like things that are not independant, and
xmobar supposed to accompany Xmonad another tiling window manager.

Polybar might not be available in package, so you have to get it in source,
lemonbar is not noob friendly and tint2 is the easiest of them all.

So get tint2 and apply your own settings to it. It is almost limitless
with what you can do with it. Change the icons. The transperancy, and what
have you. It's the easiest amongst them.

I however picked up polybar, although its configuration system is not that
unfamiliar to us window users who played with software and game ini, this is
perhaps the first time where we edit most everything. Be sure to check the wiki
on the polybar's github on what you can and cannot do.

Lemonbar is far more difficult for new users and it haven't been update as of
recently. This is better if you know what you are doing, and it takes far
less system resources than either of the above. Just that you have more
scripting experience.

FONTS

If you want to install bitmap fonts
you have to delete /etc/fonts/conf.d/70-no-bitmaps.conf

 sudo fc-cache -fv

To install a bitmap font

wget https://github.com/stark/siji/tree/master/pcf/siji.pcf

cp it to your home fonts directory
if not, create one

mkdir ~/.local/share/fonts/misc


run these two commands
mkfontdir
mkfontscale
cat fonts.dir

xfd -fa siji to see if it working

refresh your cache
fc-cache -f

check if it exist
fc-list | grep siji

one more step

xset fp+ ~/.local/share/fonts/misc

If you want to check one more time use"

xfontself -fn siji

Click and hover the fndry menu, you will notice wuncon,
then fmly which is siji you can keep going and it will appear just like our 'cat
fonts.dir' command.

If you want to install ttf fonts with icons, check our nerdfonts.
https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts

It has all the things you want for your bar. Installation shouldn't be that hard
either it be installed from gnome font viewer or just install it in your
~/.local/share/fonts and then run fc-cache -f. This is also useful
if you want to use icons in applications like Ranger and used the patched
fonts in your terminal.

You might have gucharmap, you can go to the 'Private Use Area' part of the
charset of a particular font, you can find most of all the icons available
there.

COLOR SCHEMER

Now, let's try pywall and see what's the buzz is about. If you don't have pip3
installed, it's a good time to have it. It's a python package manager that
handles python packages in its own repository. Make sure you have the
dependancies for pywal, so check its github page:

https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/wiki/Installation

Since I want pywal to change to the background that I selected,
I will change this is to my fehchanger script:
'''
    -Remove this line:
    feh --bg-fill --no-fehbg --randomize /home/$USER/Pictures/Wallpapers/*

    +Add this:
    location=$(find "/home/$USER/Pictures/Wallpapers" -type f -print0
    | shuf -z -n 1)
    feh --bg-fill --no-fehbg "$location"
    echo "$location" > ~/.local/bin/piclocation.txt
'''

And in your .bashrc file append this line:
location=$(cat ~/.local/bin/fehlocation.txt)
wal -q -n -i "$location"

The first line of code simply generates a filename from the selected folder
and adds it to the location variable. Let feh use the new file and echo
it to a textfile.

Then in  your bashrc, again we make another variable with similar name
and this time we add it to wal. This ensures that wal only starts when we
launch our terminal. Pretty sure there is a much efficient way, but this is
what I came up so far. Open a terminal and you will get beautiful thematics
that affects your terminal. Though, you can just use a preset for your terminal
if you want to.

Speaking of Terminals. Let's talk about some of them. Some people
like urxvt and stick it. Many distro come default with it as a backup.

However for many ricer, three choices come top: Kitty, Termite and Alacritty.

I decided to install Alacritty(through Cargo installer, it's like pip3 but for
rustlang) to see the hype around it. It claims to be the fastest term emu around
, and honestly it does pop faster than xfce4-terminal but I had to create a
specific config for it. I tried kitty and then removed. Found out I am not a fan
of software made in interpreted languages, even if they are gpu accelerated,
if there is a faster and better looking alternative, in this case Alacritty,
which uses the all new hyped system language Rust.

Next is, what other software we can do to rice our linux? Well, of course term
programs and here is my recommended list:

        >   cava - a visualizor for command line.
        >   fish - another shell interpretor, however it has its own specific
                 style of syntax, I prefer it over the regular bash interpretor,
                 since it has out of the box functionalities like completion.
        >   moc  - music on console, a music console player with an added in
                 menu. Used this with mpd to run the songs being played on your
                 bar.
        >   ranger - a console file manager. There is an addon that let's you
                     use nerdfont icon fonts, so it is kind of neat for that.
