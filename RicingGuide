Okay, since I want to learn how to "Rice" a Linux. I have to download some packages for me to rice.

For this guide, we will use the base install terminal emulator and bash. Since I am on Mint Face, my terminal is xfec4-terminal and the regular bash. There are alternative terminal emulators and shell clis, but I will go with the base for this guide for the sake of simplicity. 

There are some several installations before we begin.

First come are the window managers. My preference is awesome and openbox for starters, we will begin with them. 

We will begin with openbox - assuming we have the gtk2.0+ dependancies installed in our system, if not, our package manager will do it for ourselves.


So we need to install four programs
    > openbox -OpenBox is your window manager.
    > obconf  -Obconf will configure openbox's visuals
    > menumaker -Menumaker will configure your context menu i.e the right click menu*
        *You can download this here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/menumaker/

After you got the above, install these: 
    > rofi  -Rofi is an application launcher, basically type in the program you want to launch it; there are several alternatives, but this one is better for beginners.
    > lxappearance -This will help select the gtk theme borders of your graphical programs. There is oomox, but this one is far easier.
    > compton/picom - This is a compositor able to be used on windowmanagers rather than DE's like compiz, it will give your more graphical effects like dropshadow and transperancy
    > nitrogen - This is a wallpaper selector, there is Feh as an alternative, but requires more scripting
    

Obviously, no Rice is complete without added things, like
